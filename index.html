            <h3>Short description about me:</h3>
            <p>
                I'm <span class="age">life years</span>-year old Swedish guy and I make games. I've been working with <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> and
                C# for around <span class="unity-age">Unity years</span> years. So far I've produced and published 3 games (see further down).
                My main interests in game development are general programming (systems, gameplay, logic, everything!) and CPU optimizations. (basically
                making code as efficient as possible)<br>
                I've also been playing around with making "normal Windows software". I have some experience with Windows Forms and C# console applications.
                And as you probably can tell, I know a small amount of HTML and CSS.<br><br>
                I would personally say I'm pretty fluent in English and Swedish.<br><br>
                I don't have any prior "real" working experience, mostly due to not being old enough to work properly yet. But I have actually been
                teaching some basic programming. I taught basic visual programming (like <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>), Python and some C#.<br><br>
                Lastly, I respect the ones that respect me back.

            <h3>Longer description about me:</h3>
            <p>
                As mentioned above, I'm a <span class="age">life years</span>-year old Swedish guy that likes to make games. I've been working with the game engine
                <a href="https://unity3d.com">Unity</a> and the accompanying programming language C# for at least <span class="unity-age">unity years</span> years.
                I've basically been working non-stop all those years and been making lots of prototypes. But I have actually fully released 3 games! 2 free and 1
                commercial. The games are <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/santa-s-jetpack/41725">Santa's Jetpack</a>,
                <a href="https://hertzole.itch.io/jumps">Jumps</a>, and Quible Sphere. I want to actively grow that list of games and produce more free and commercial
                games!<br><br>
                My favorite thing to do when making games is basically just programming. Of course, I do art and such for my own projects, but I enjoy the programming
                aspect much more! I like to code anything! Systems, logic, gameplay, you name it! But my most favorite thing is optimization. I really want to provide
                a smooth experience for the user and I'm not afraid to go one extra step to make an object pool, rewrite code or whatever would be needed. I want to make
                the code as easy as possible for the CPU to do!<br><br>
                I've also been playing around with traditional non-game software. I've got some experience with Windows Forms and C# console applications. Haven't really
                released anything like that but at least I've learned from the experience.<br><br>
                I also have some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But I need to search for a lot of things when doing anything in JS. I still haven't gotten
                entirely used to it.<br><br>
                I would also personally say that I'm pretty fluent in English and Swedish (obviously because it's my main language). It does happen that some word in
                Enligh will stump me for the moment but I will learn it once I've heard it once or twice! But I might also randomly drop some words, in both English
                and Swedish, but it doesn't stop me from properly communicating! (I'm only human, I should be allowed to make some minor mistakes!)<br><br>
                I don't have any "real" working experience. That is mostly due to me not being old enough to actually work. I've never been out and worked with other
                people, at least in the game/software development field. But I have, however, taught some basic programming to younger children and teenagers. I taught
                visual programming, like <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, Python and some C#. It was mostly basic concepts in programming, like
                conditions and the way of thinking when programming.<br><br>
                Lastly, but something very important to me: I respect anyone that respects me back.
