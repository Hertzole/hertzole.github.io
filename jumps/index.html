            <h3>About the game:</h3>
            <p>
                The goal of the game is to finish each stage by jumping on different colored blocks. These blocks have unique abilities, like some blocks
                give you more jump height and some make you super fast! Sometimes there are doors in the way that you need to get keys for.
            </p>
            <h3>Development story:</h3>
            <p>
                The development of Jumps was a bit rocky. It started out as a school project where we had one week to make an "invention", and our group
                decided to make a game. I was basically the one creating the whole games while the rest came with ideas and made levels. We finished the game
                for the first week and it had 10 levels and was pretty basic. We uploaded it for free on <a href="https://gamejolt.com">GameJolt</a> and labeled
                it as a demo.<br><br>
                After that I took a bit of a break but was quickly back at it, expanding the game, adding more blocks and levels. It was starting to take shape.
                But because of the lack of proper structure on my part, the game quickly became a mess to work with and development slowed down a lot. But I managed
                to pull through and released it later that summer. I released it on GameJolt for $0.99.<br><br>
                Then eventually I decided I wanted to make a game for <a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a>, so I picked up the game again, added some new blocks,
                made it react accordingly depending on which edition it was, added a new "level pack" and released it on itch. But now I decided to make it free,
                so it became free on both itch and GameJolt, and that's how it's been for a while now. I've tried to fix it up and do something with it but it's such
                a mess and I don't want to talk about it...
            </p>
