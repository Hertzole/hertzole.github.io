            <h3>About the game:</h3>
            <p>
                You are a small ball, named Quible, that has to navigate several stages on narrow platforms. But there are several obstacles in your way
                that do their best to stop you from getting to the end.
            </p>
            <h3>Development story:</h3>
            <p>
                The game was first conceived in 2014 but was never finished. Then a game jam happened were you basically had to revive an old project and so I decided
                to pick it up again after ~4 years. But due to reasons, it didn't get finished in time. But I stuck with it and continued to work on it. Eventually,
                it became better and better, with more features than originally planned.<br>
                Then I decided to get a Steam license for the game and upload it there so I could take advantage of all the neat features Steam offers you, like the
                workshop, leaderboards, and achievements. So far it's been pretty smooth and is continuing forward.
            </p>
            <h3>Get the game:</h3>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, the game is not ready for distribution yet. Whenever it is, a link will appear here! There's no estimated time either for when it will
                be released.
