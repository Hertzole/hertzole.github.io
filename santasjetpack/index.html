            <h3>About the game:</h3>
            <p>
                The goal of the game is to get as far as possible with Santa using a jetpack. You have to avoid several obstacles like trees,
                snowmen, and reindeer. You have a limited fuel supply but can get more fuel by picking up presents.
            </p>
            <h3>Development story:</h3>
            <p>
                The game idea was first conceived by my friend who thought it would be funny. So when I got home from school, I spent the weekend
                making it into a simple game. It was pretty basic. The obstacles were there and the presents, but not much else. But at least it was
                ready for Christmas!<br>
                Then later I recreated the game from scratch and included some new visual things, sounds, and features, like lives and GameJolt scoreboards.
                I just felt like fixing the game up a bit since I found it fun to play from time to time but I felt like it was missing a few things.
            </p>
